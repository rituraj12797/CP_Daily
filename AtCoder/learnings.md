|       https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc424/tasks/abc424_d      |    Bitmask DP ==> how get this intution ==> See constraints + greedy approach of  Add your problems and learnings in the table above.flipping max dependent cells firt will fail due to ordering and whever constraints are low and ordering can matter look for BitMask DP                               |
